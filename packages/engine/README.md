# About Stackmate
Stackmate's purpose and focus is providing developers with a low-code tool that manages their infrastructure, without any additional knowledge. 

It uses Terraform behind the scenes and abstracts away the HCL part, since the only configuration required is a very small YAML file.

It also embeds some best practices that are known and widely used by Cloud Engineers and SREs.
